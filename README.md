An idea spawned by [this HackerNews comment][hackcomment].  The idea is
basically that when a buffer is empty enter insert mode automatically, if it
isn't empty then nothing happens, you're still in Normal mode.

It is important to note that it only works on buffers that have a physical
location linked to them as well.  In other words, only works on buffers that
are associated with a file in the file system.

I realize that this is probably a better solution to this problem:

Unless you're a cool DIY person (like myself).
